# Network-Topology-Project

Clarkson University
CS350 Class project


Given a network topology/reachability information defined in a file, the application will be able to take the file as input and store the topology into NoSQL database tables (MongoDB). 
Taking advantage of shortest path algorithms(given), the application needs to calculate shortests paths for any pairs of nodes and store  them in another table. WIth this information, 
the application will be able to retrieve the calculated results easily. A more advanced feature is to handle various topology/route update events.


Upload a file, of the correct format, to the server, using the upload button.

Hit the calculate button.

And the shortest path from a to b will be generated in the output section.
